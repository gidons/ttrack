Improvements
-------------
- Improve speed control:
  - Import new version of Sonic; probably means adding an AudioProcessor and ignoring the build-in SonicProcessor
  - Increase sampling frequency during pitch determination
  - Set useChordPitch=true
  - Try to always use the single-voice channel for pitch determination
  - Try to use both channels for pitch determination
